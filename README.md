# M-Pesa-App-Practice
By opening up the index.html file, 
the user should be prompted with options simulating the UI of an M-Pesa app. At the time of this commit, the 'app' 
could simulate checking one's airtime balance on the Safaricom side and the M-Pesa balance and making paybill payments on the M-Pesa option side.
