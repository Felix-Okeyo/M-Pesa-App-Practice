# M-Pesa-App-Practice
This directory contains two files and index.html and index.js file. By opening up the index.html file, 
the user should be prompted with options simulating the UI of an M-Pesa app. By the time of this commit, the 'app' 
could simulate checking one's airtime balance on the Safaricom side and the M-Pesa balance on the M-Pesa option side.
